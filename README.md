# Pulse-Code-Modulation-
In this project, I implemented the Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) algorithm using MATLAB. PCM is a digital representation technique commonly used in audio and speech applications. 

First, I converted the analog input signal into a discrete-time signal by sampling it at regular intervals. 

Next, I quantized the sampled values by mapping them to a finite set of discrete levels. The number of levels determined the bit depth or resolution of the PCM signal. 

To encode the quantized levels, I represented them as binary numbers using a fixed number of bits. 

Finally, I reconstructed the analog signal by converting the binary representation back into analog values, resulting in a digital-to-analog conversion. 

Overall, this project showcased the essential steps of the PCM algorithm, enabling the conversion of analog signals into a digital format suitable for storage, transmission, and subsequent reconstruction.
